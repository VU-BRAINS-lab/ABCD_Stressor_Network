**Overview of project**

The present study characterized functional network properties across rest, reward processing, and executive functioning states to deepen our understanding of network-level differences associated with environmental stressors.

**Data sources, description**

This project utilizes data from the ABCD Study Dataset

**Approach**

This study used hierarchical modeling of environmental stressors established in [Jeong et al. 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667174322000593). Please refer to [Jeong_Environmental_Bifactor](https://github.com/VU-BRAINS-lab/Jeong_Environmental_Bifactor) for the detailed documentation of hierarchical modeling of environmental stressors. Graph theory was used to establish functional topology metrics.
